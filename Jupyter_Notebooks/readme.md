Here you have the Jupyter examples that we will use in the workshop. While ideally, to execute these examples you do not need to have installed SHERLOCK. Instead, you can only install the packages listed below. If you already have any of them on your computer but in a different version, execute any of the notebooks to test if it works well. If you have any problem, try creating a virtual environment. 

All the packages are installable via `pip`.

```
lightkurve==2.4.0
numpy==1.23.5   
matplotlib==3.5.2 
pandas==1.5.3 
wotan==1.9 
foldedleastsquares==1.0.42 
astropy==5.0.4 
scipy==1.8.0 
```
